주만지.
we are turning this into a new computer center.
but before we do it, it has to be cleaned out.
all of this old magazines are bound for the recycling... plant.
but they have to be properly... prepped_ before they go.

prepped 준비된
be bound = 꽁꽁 묶이다

=we will make this computer room
=this will be renovated... into a  computer center.

popsong. mercy.
I love you.
but I gotta stay true_ .
my morals got me on my nees... I'm begging_ please stop playing games.


stay true 감정에 솔직해지다
on one's nee... 무릎을 꿇는
beg 빌다 간청하다
