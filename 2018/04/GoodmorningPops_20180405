주만지.
I've been so anxious_ for your arrival.
as you know 주만지 is in grave danger.
we are counting on four of you to lift the curse.
curse? what curse?
excuse me, have you seen my phone anywhere?

be anxious for 갈망하다 열망하다
in grave danger_ 위험에 처하다
counting on_ 기대다 의지하다
lift the curse_ 저주를 풀다
under a curse 저주에 걸려있다

= I've been looking forward to get in you here??

popsong.
baby you've been going so crazy.
lately_ nothing seems to be going right.
so row, why do you have to get so row?
you are so, you've been waiting in the sun too long.

in the sun 태양 아래서

bootcamp. reservation. booking.
how could you make two appointments at the same time?
I'm so sorry. I completly forgot about the other one.
when you come back let's get to the bottom of this.

= explain it all.
