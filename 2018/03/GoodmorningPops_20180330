for my self I declare I dont know anything about it but the sight of the stars always makes me dreams.
why I say to my self should douse...spots of light in the firmament_ (should) be inaccesible?
maybe we can take death to go to a star and to die piecefully an old age would be to go there on foot.

on foot 걸어가다
 firmament_ 창공, 하늘
= I swear I have no information about it.
= I promise there is nothing I know about it

you are still the one I run to the one that I belong to
you are still the one I want for life_
you are the still the one that I love the only want I dream
-- I kiss good night

bootcamp. festival.
총정리임.
