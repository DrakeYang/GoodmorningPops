loving vincent 

I would never send a report normaly.

I mean this was 가쉐's case.

then I read that the patiant... died 2 days later in his room.

so I felt that I should for the record.

I ask the patient... how it happend he said he had shot...슛의과거분사 him self.

but I knew he hadn't.

I could tell by his wound.

=I recognize that from his wound.

=his wound told me that.

popsong. tell me its real.

baby you told me that you love me and you would never leave my side .

through... the bitter and tru... the thick  and thin

you promised me baby that you wasn't going anywhere yes you did.

baby keep it real let me know just how you feel.


bootcamp. concert... festival and show.
