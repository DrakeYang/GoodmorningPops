loving vincent.
you want to know so much about his death.
but what do you know of his life?
I know that he tried hard to prove he was good for something.
yes he did. thats why I take flowers to his grave.
that's all I can do for him now.
He would appreciate the delicate beauty of the bloom.

popsong. tell me its real.
I can't explain the way you make me feel every time that you tell me that you love me.
and you know you did so many times.
just when I thought that love could never be a part of me.
that's when you came alone  to my happiness.??
